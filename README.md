## Welcome to my stuff 
Just some of my own projects. For some of the open source work I've done, check out [this PR for Real Python](https://github.com/realpython/materials/pull/157). Here are my two awesome lists: [python console modules](https://github.com/Znunu/awesome-python-terminal) and [awesome product reviewers](https://github.com/Znunu/awesome-product-reviewers/blob/main/README.md)
